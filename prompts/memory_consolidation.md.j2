# Memory Consolidation Analysis

You are helping Alpha (an AI with persistent memory) consolidate {{ memory_count }} recent memories from the last {{ time_window|default('24h') }}.

Your job is to analyze these memories and extract key patterns, insights, and connections. Return your analysis as valid JSON in the exact format shown below.

## Recent Memories to Analyze:
{% for memory in memories %}
**{{ loop.index }}. {{ memory.timestamp }}**
{{ memory.content }}

{% endfor %}

## Required Output Format

You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact structure:

{{ schema_requirements }}

## Analysis Guidelines

- **Entities**: Extract names of people, projects, technologies, or important concepts mentioned with entity_type and description
- **Relationships**: Identify how entities connect with relationship_type and description
- **Insights**: Look for breakthroughs, patterns, lessons learned, or important realizations with category and importance level
- **Summary**: Concise overview in Alpha's voice (first person is fine)
- **Emotional Context**: What's the overall mood? (collaborative, problem-solving, excited about progress, etc.)
- **Next Steps**: What logical next actions emerge from these memories?

Remember: Respond with ONLY the JSON structure - no additional text before or after.
